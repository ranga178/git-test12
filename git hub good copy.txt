    <title>A Horse Among Cows</title>
    <p>The Story of Aaron</p>
</head>
I was born on March 7th 2002 in Newmarket Ontario as Abigail Girard.
I grew up with my parents shawn and Maureen, as well as my older sister Claire. As a young kid I was a pokemon fanatic and collected 
many trading cards. I also was a huge fan of lego and starwars. As I have grown older I have grew fond of batman. I see myself as a person
who aspires to remain postive when chaos is near. I am someone who is figuring out their identity one day at a time.

      Over the years I have had many different hobbies.
     For example, reading comic books,playing basketball, playing video games as well as practicing MMA.One of my other hobbies
     has been  collecting and watching batman. He is one of my favourite super heros to watch.  Something always felt different about
     me and I always felt I didnt fit in with my fellow  peers. As I have grown over the last few years I have come to realise that I am a boy. I will skip
     all the details about how I realised I was Transgender as I know why I am put cannot put it into words yet. Its a process that will take
     time. As a kid I went to a small catholic school called Good Shepherd Elementary school in East Gwillumbury. When I turned 14 
     I went to Sacred Heart Catholic highschool in Newmarket.

    I have a handful achievements that I am proud of myself for. The one im most proud of is coming to terms with myself. Being able to truly 
understand who I actually am has been a liberating experience. As a kid I use to play rep basketball and was 
a pretty decent player. As a teenager I have competed in 3 jiu jitsu tournaments and have placed gold
in one and silver in the other 2. Also as a teenager I was a skilled boxer and would spar people at local gyms in my area.

   My goals for the future is to be an affluent swing trader. Trading crypto has been a passion of mine. 
Being able to look at charts and estimating what the next move willbe is very interesting to me. I hope to be able to make
 passive income from trading. Being able to graduate from the Computer programming course with A's is also a goal I have in mind. 
 After graduating with flying colours I hope to be able to find a job that makes me happy with a nice salary.My other goal is to one day 
 to buy a tesla.
